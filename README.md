<p>LockIT is a window lock made to protect all your confidential data from unauthorized accesses. LockIT replaces the original window login lock and it is a simple paradigm based on the generation of a unique OTP key every time based on four factors:</p>
<ol>     
<li>	<b>Password: </b>This acts as a backup password, Also internally the unique key is dependent on this, can be of your choice, must be at least 6 characters long.
</li>
<li>
<b>IMEI Number:</b> For every device, there is a unique IMEI, LockIT uses this IMEI number and make the generation of unique OTP key unique for every device i.e. The same details if filled in another device will not generate the same OTP key, can be found by dialing *#06# in your keypad.
</li>
<li>
<b>Period or Validity period: </b>The time for which a particular OTP key will be valid is determined by the Validity Period.  
Example: if you set Period=10 min, then for 5:00 to 5:10, a unique key will be generated, for 5:11 to 5:20 unique key will be generated.
</li>
<li>
<b>DateAndTime: </b>LockIT generates unique OTP key dependent on date and time, So every time a unique OTP key will be generated from LockIT APK.     
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
